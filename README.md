This is a simple Audio Plug-In using JUCE, see www.juce.com.

It was made to check out the facilities and how to use
AudioProcessorValueTreeState.

It features loading/saving of a plugins complete state.

To have some fun, it is a simple delay with feedback.

Apropos feedback, feedback is very welcome:
